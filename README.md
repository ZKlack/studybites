# StudyBites

I intend to make a tool to help me study by itemizing new information and assigning a cooldown and a proficiency level to each item where the I review items that are off cooldown and change the proficiency level depending on the result and setting a new cooldown based on the new proficiency level.

- I found out this is almost identical to the [Leitner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system) where flashcards are sorted into boxes assigned to diffrent groups of sessions.
